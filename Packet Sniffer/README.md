## Usage
```
sudo python3 network_scanner.py
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
```

* Change the interface in the *packet_sniffer.py* code if you are using a different wireless network interface


* *formatter.py* is a small python program I made for myself to remove the UTF-8 hex code from my terminal which was being shown while intercepting the data and thus clean the packets [change the file name in the file command if you want to use it]
