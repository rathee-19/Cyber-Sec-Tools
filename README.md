# Cyber-Sec-Tools

A collection of Python-based security tools and scripts demonstrating core cybersecurity concepts such as MAC address spoofing, ARP poisoning, packet sniffing, and more. These tools aim to help users understand how attackers might exploit network vulnerabilities and how to defend against them. **Use responsibly and only in testing or authorized environments.**

## Features

1. **MAC Changer**  
   - Changes a systemâ€™s MAC address.  
   - Highlights basics of Python I/O, regular expressions, and interface manipulation.

2. **Network Scanner**  
   - Discovers all clients on a network and displays their IP and MAC addresses.  
   - Utilizes Scapy for sending ARP requests and parsing responses.

3. **ARP Spoofer**  
   - Performs ARP spoofing to intercept and modify traffic between devices.  
   - Showcases how to analyze network layers and handle exceptions in Python.

4. **Packet Sniffer**  
   - Captures and displays data sent or received on the same network.  
   - Demonstrates parsing packets, analyzing layers, and potential payload injection.
